Navigate seamlessly in the universe of european price statistics

This app enables to easily produce a graph for the all-items level or any subcomponent(s) in the european HICP (Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices). Users can also choose countries and set a new reference period, common for all selected index series. 

How to use:

1. Select countries from the list.

2. Select product categories and press Retrieve data.

3. Set a reference/base year for the index series and press Update plot.


Note:

It's possible to zoom in on a certain time period by just press down the left mouse button and drag the pointer over a certain area in the graph. It's also possible to save the re-referenced data to CSV using the Download data-button.

In some cases a country may lack data for a subcomponent, if so no data will be shown in the graph.
